Handling large volumes of data with a spread sheet like interface

Intro
-----

This project is a proof of concept for building apps that allow feeding large volumes of structured data to the browser, exploring and manipulating it and updating it in real time. We'd like to explore how the idea of uni-directional dataflow, and large volumes of data work in the browser. We also want to try integrating with existing 3rd party widget sets.
